This Wolf3d was created as a school project.

Created in pure C. It is a imitation of the First Person Shooter game [Wolfenstein 3d](http://3d.wolfenstein.com/game_EU.php).

Clone with :

```
git clone https://github.com/kmjaku/Wolf-3d---Wolfenstein-3d.git ~/Wolf3d
cd ~/Wolf3d

you have to replace 'example' in this next step by 1 or 2. 1 is for untextured and 2 is for textured
